## Database manager

##### The app has 2 managers: SQLite and cache

Navigate to lib/main.dart if you want to switch between them and change this line by `Manager` values
For example, you can switch to cache using the `CacheManager()` value instead of `SqlDatabase()`
```dart
 ToDoRepository.getInstance(SqlDatabase())
```
