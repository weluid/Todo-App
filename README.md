## Tech
---
Libraries used in the project:

- [Bloc] - makes it easy to separate UI from business logic, making code fast and reusable
- [Sqflite] - allows Flutter apps to discover network connectivity
- [Flutter Localization] - provides localization facilities, including message translation
- [Animated theme switcher] - animation to change the theme 
- [Flutter slidable] -  implementation of slidable list item with directional slide actions that can be dismissed
- [Firebase Core] - connecting app to Firebase
- [Firebase Crashlytics] - realtime crash reporter that helps you track, prioritize, and fix errors

## Database manager
---
##### The app has 2 managers: SQLite and cache

Navigate to lib/main.dart if you want to switch between them and change this line by `Manager` values
For example, you can switch to cache using the `CacheManager()` value instead of `SqlDatabase()`
```dart
 ToDoRepository.getInstance(SqlDatabase())
```
