Tech
Libraries used in the project:

Bloc - makes it easy to separate UI from business logic, making code fast and reusable
Sqflite - allows Flutter apps to discover network connectivity
Flutter Localization - provides localization facilities, including message translation
Animated theme switcher - animation to change the theme
Flutter slidable - implementation of slidable list item with directional slide actions that can be dismissed
Firebase Core - connecting app to Firebase
Firebase Crashlytics - realtime crash reporter that helps you track, prioritize, and fix errors
Database manager
The app has 2 managers: SQLite and cache
Navigate to lib/main.dart if you want to switch between them and change this line by Manager values
For example, you can switch to cache using the CacheManager() value instead of SqlDatabase()

 ToDoRepository.getInstance(SqlDatabase())
